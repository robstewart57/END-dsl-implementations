* This program

This audio-processing.cpp program demonstrates that the Halide image
processing DSL can be used for processing other domain data, and not
just images.

To compile, you'll nee Halide installed and also the midifile C++
library from https://github.com/craigsapp/midifile. Then

#+BEGIN_SRC
HALIDE_HOME=/home/you/place/Halide/ MIDIFILE_HOME=/home/you/place/midifile make
#+END_SRC

Then to run:

#+BEGIN_SRC
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/you/place/Halide/bin/ ./a.out pathetique_3_format0-c-minor.mid
#+END_SRC

The music is in C minor. This will generated a happy.midi file, in the
parallel major key C major, i.e. E flats become E, B flats become B
and A flats become A.
